Bluetooth Low Energy Tools for Android
======================================

This collection of tools and utility classes is meant for using the bluetooth low energy functions of the 
Android 4.3 and above. This project has just started and I don't have a common pattern how 
to implement all the goals. If you're working on BLE and have some reusable functions or classes 
please consider adding them to this tools collection.

The goals of the project are as follows:

 * design and implement patterns for the communication with BLE sensors
 * implement parsers for all the known characteristics
 * collect and implement parsers for proprietary sensors and characteristics
 * implement classes to read all values of a sensors
 * implement a fingerprint DB for sensors
